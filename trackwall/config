# Comments start with #. 
# 
# All options are in the form of "key value1 [value2 ...]"
# 
# All options can be split over multiple lines by indenting the next lines with
# one or more spaces or tabs (the amount don't matter). So this:
#
# user
#   _trackwall
#
# is the same as:
#
# user _trackwall
#
# Note that option keys *must not* have leading whitespace, this:
#
# user _trackwall
#  chroot /var/trackwall
#
# is seen as:
#
# user _trackwall chroot /var/trackwall
#
# Which is an error, since the user option takes only one argument.

### Basic options ###
#####################

# Used for controlling the server
control-listen 127.0.0.53:4242

# Listens on TCP and UDP
dns-listen 127.0.0.53:53

# Forward allowed requests to this nameserver.
#dns-forward 127.0.1.1:53
# Get first nameserver value from /etc/resolv.conf that is not dns-listen
# NOTE: you don't want to do this if you're using musl libc, since that sends a
# query to *all* nameservers and uses whichever one responds fastest.
#dns-forward auto
dns-forward 127.0.0.1

# We serve no-op or "surrogate" scripts from a HTTP server
http-listen 127.0.0.53:80
https-listen 127.0.0.53:443

# Root cert; relative to chroot()
# Keep these private!
root-cert /rootCA.pem
root-key /rootCA.key

# Run as this user
user _trackwall

# Chroot directory
chroot /var/trackwall

# Cache DNS responses. Note that trackwall does *not* cache the actual DNS
# responses (that's the resolver's job), it merly caches whatever action is
# taken (forward or spoof).
cache-dns 1h

# Show some colours in the output; to guarantee readability text is never
# coloured, only some whitespace is shown with a different background colour.
color yes

### Adding hosts ###
####################

# Cache remote hosts files for a week, this is especially useful for desktops
# and such which may be turned on and off several times a day.
cache-hosts 1w

# The format is:
#   hostlist format url
#
# Where format is any of:
#   plain − One host per line. No comments
#   hosts − /etc/hosts, comments and the destination address are ignored.
#
# All subdomains are also blocked, so an entry like:
#   example.net
# would block:
#   example.net
#   track.doubleclick.net
#   really.track.doubleclick.net
#   ...etc...
#
# Don't worry about redundant or duplicate entries from different lists. Those
# are automatically removed.

# These domains are used for serving malware, phising, and other outright crap.
# You probably want to keep them. Many browsers already have some built-in
# protection for this these days, but some extra protection can't hurt.
hostlist plain http://malwaredomains.lehigh.edu/files/justdomains
hostlist hosts http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/hostslist/hosts.txt

# These are a mix of ad domains, malware domains, "shock sites", and other stuff
# that most people don't want to need to visit.
hostlist plain http://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/serverlist.php?hostformat=plain&showintro=0&mimetype=plaintext 
hostlist hosts http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.txt
hostlist hosts http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/hosts

# You can also use a local file; remember that trackwall uses chroot()!
#hostlist hosts file:///hosts

# If you just want to block a few hosts, you can add rules here as well
#host conservapedia.com

# Or multiple work as well
#host facebook.com twitter.com

###############################################
### Blocking hosts from regular expressions ###
###############################################

# You can also block hosts with regular expressions.
#
# Note that this is a lot slower than using a static hosts file (which is a
# constant-time map lookup), since we need to iterate over the entire array and
# see if an expression matches on every DNS lookup (we do some caching to speed
# up subsequent lookups though).
#

# Regexps
# Only plain is supported
#regexplist plain file:///home/martin/regexps

# Or just here; multiple regexps can be separated by whitespace.
regexp
	^count(er)?[0-9]+?\.
	^banners?[0-9]+?\.
	^ad(s|srv|serv|serve|server|v|vert)?[0-9]+?\.

#########################
### Customizing hosts ###
#########################

# Does a hostlist have hosts you would like to keep? Remove them! unhost takes a
# regexp and removes all hosts that match it. It's always executed *after*
# loading all the hostsfile (so putting this at the top of this file would work
# just as well).

# Listed in someonewhocares, but seems okay?
unhost grokbase.com

# You can also load it from a file (which can be remote).
#unhostlist plain file:///myunhosts

# The same can be done for regexps. Note that this is *not* a regexp (matching
# regexps with a regexp is a bit of a mindfuck).
#unregexp ^count(er)?[0-9]+?\.

# And again, from a file
#unregexplist file:///unregexps


#########################
### Surrogate scripts ###
#########################

# Some sites will break when they can't load some JavaScript. It'll error out
# and none of the JavaScript works (which in some cases means the entire site
# stops working).
# To fix this, trackwall can serve surrogate scripts, the format is simple:
#
#   surrogate domain_regex JavaScript to serve
#
# @@ will be replaced by function(){}

# AddThis
surrogate ^s\d+\.addthis\.com$
	addthis={init:@@,layers:@@,toolbox:@@,button:@@,counter:@@}

# Google tag manager
surrogate .*googletag(manager|services)\.com$
	var googletag;
	googletag={
	enableServices:@@, refresh:@@, defineOutOfPageSlot:@@, setTargeting:@@,
	display:@@, setRefreshUnfilledSlots:@@, enableAsyncRendering:@@,
	enableSyncRendering:@@, enableSingleRequest:@@, collapseEmptyDivs:@@,
	cmd:{push:@@},
	defineSlot:function(){return googletag},
	addService:function(){return googletag},
	companionAds:function(){return googletag},
	pubads:function(){return googletag},
	publish:function(){return googletag}
	}

# http://ak.sail-horizon.com/horizon/v1.js
surrogate ak\.sail-horizon\.com$
	window.Sailthru={setup:@@}

#???
# http://tags.bkrtx.com/js/bk-coretag.js
# http://regdev.idge.int/api/"
# "http://reg.idgenterprise.com/api/";
