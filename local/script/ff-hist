#
# Usage:
# 
#     $ ff-hist term
# 
# This will search for the term in the URL and title as 'like %..%'.
# 
# To limit to just the URL or title, prefix with url: or title:
# 
#     $ ff-hist title:term
# 
# You can add multiple, which are AND'd together:
# 
#     $ ff-hist term title:other
# 
# To OR together, add "or:"
# 
#       $ ff-hist title:term url:or:reddit.com or:asd
# 
# The output is aligned in columns to fit the window; add -full to always
# dispaly everything.
# 
# Use -show to echo the SQL query before running, or -showonly to just show the
# URL and exit.
# 
# You can get the full URL by giving the ID (first column in output):
# 
#       $ ff-hist 42
#       $ ff-hist 42,666
#       $ ff-hist 42 666   # Identical
# 
# All the parameter can also be passed from stdin if the first argument is `-`;
# parameters are separated by newlines.
# 
# You can pipe this to `fzf` or `dmenu` or whatever if you wish:
# 
#     $ ff-hist hello | dmenu | cut -d' ' -f1 | ff-hist - | xclip -rmlastnl -selection clipboard
